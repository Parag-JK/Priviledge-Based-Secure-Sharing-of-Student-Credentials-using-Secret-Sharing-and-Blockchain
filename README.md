# Priviledge-Based-Secure-Sharing-of-Student-Credentials-using-Secret-Sharing-and-Blockchain
Blockchain technology, which is well-known for being decentralized and unchangeable, provides a transparent and tamper-proof platform for storing and validating shared credentials. With the help ofÂ blockchain, the system may keep an everlasting and verifiable record of the credential-sharing process, fostering confidence and enabling speedy verification by educational institutions, employers, or other authorized authorities. Additionally, in order to address the privacy concerns created by credential sharing, student privilege is crucial. The right to privacy is protected and the risk of misuse or unauthorized disclosure is decreased when students have the capacity to control who has access to and how their credentials are distributed. This helps to preserve students' right to privacy.

Therefore, the motivation of the proposed paperwork is to create and build a complete system that combines blockchain technology with the student privilege system. The proposed approach aims to improve the security, privacy, and effectiveness of the credential sharing process, thereby supporting students, educational institutions, employers, and other parties involved in the sharing and verification process. 

The main objectives of our model are:

Create a reliable and secure system: The main goal is to plan and set up a system for the secure transmission of student credentials. SISS is used for splitting credentials into shares and use of IPFS network for decentralized storage and for further verification and transparency blockchain technology is used.

Controlled access to credentials:The system attempts to ensure that access to student credentials is controlled. This means that only authorized parties can request and decrypt credentials. The goal is to establish a secure, consent-based exchange method that is accomplished through collaboration between students and authorized parties.

The goal is to establish a secure, consent-based exchange method that is accomplished through collaboration between students and authorized parties.

Providing student privilege: Students would feel more empowered during the sharing process if they were given control over their own credentials. In order to safeguard their privacy and keep ownership of their academic achievements, students will have the choice of accepting or rejecting access to their share.

Use blockchain for immutability and transparency: The objective is to provide a transparent and immutable record of credential-sharing operations using blockchain technology. The blockchain's decentralized structure boosts trust and enables stakeholders to verify the legitimacy and integrity of the shared credentials.

Examine scalability and efficiency: The purpose of this paper is to address scalability and efficiency issues associated with exchanging large numbers of student transcripts. The goal is to implement IPFS on distributed storage and improve system speed so that the system can manage a large number of requests and provide an effective release mechanism.

The system, which combines the benefits of blockchain for immutability and tamper-resistance, IPFS for decentralized and scalable file storage, and multi-secret sharing for data secrecy, offers a solid solution for the secure sharing of student credentials. The system can offer a dependable and effective mechanism for safeguarding student credentials, upholding privacy, and guaranteeing restricted access in educational settings and beyond by putting the suggested approach into practice and taking future research fields into account.
